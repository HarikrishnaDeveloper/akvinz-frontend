          The Company reserves the right to revise the Fixed Monthly Rental and Excess Usage Fee at the time of plan
          renewal, or during the subsisting term upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Subscriber, to

          Prior to delivery, the Subscriber must upload valid Know Your Customer (KYC) documents: Identity Proof (PAN
          card and Aadhaar/Passport) and Address Validation (House tax invoice if owner OR a valid, registered Rental
          Agreement if tenant).

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">ii. Physical Verification</h5>
        <p>
          A Company-authorized technician will visit the designated premises within 72 hours of deposit payment to run
          document authentication, inspect structural plumbing, and log the primary installation coordinates.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iii. Deployment Logging</h5>
        <p>
          Upon physical installation, a digital snapshot of the functioning unit along with the Subscriber at the site
          will be securely logged via the Company&apos;s backend administration portal and WhatsApp API to initialize the
          billing engine.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iv. Installation Feasibility &amp; Company Authority</h5>
        <p>
          Installation of the Product is subject to site suitability and plumbing feasibility as determined by the
          Company&apos;s authorized technician during the verification visit. If the premises are found unsuitable for
          installation due to structural, plumbing, or safety constraints, the Company reserves the right to refuse
          installation without liability and the Security Deposit shall be refunded within 7–10 working days.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">v. Structural Alterations &amp; Restoration</h5>
        <p>
          The Subscriber grants the Company permission to perform necessary minor plumbing modifications and
          structural wall-drilling required for standard equipment mounting. Upon contract termination or relocation,
          the Company&apos;s sole responsibility is the safe de-installation and retrieval of its Equipment. The Company
          shall not be held liable or responsible for restoring, painting, or patching walls, countertops, or
          structural plumbing lines to their original state.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Subscriber agrees that only Company-authorized personnel may perform installation, removal, or

        <h4 className="text-white font-semibold">5. Maintenance, Servicing, &amp; IoT Operations</h4>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">i. Complimentary Regular Maintenance</h5>
        <p>
          The Company provides zero-cost routine preventative maintenance, including periodic filter assessments and
          replacement of exhausted consumable spares (sediment filters, carbon blocks, RO membranes), provided the
          unit is operating under normal wear-and-tear conditions. This complimentary maintenance is conditional on
          the Subscriber granting the Company&apos;s technician timely access to carry out scheduled preventive-maintenance
          visits; if the Subscriber repeatedly refuses or reschedules such a visit, the Company shall be relieved of
          liability for any resulting fault and may treat the resulting repair as chargeable.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">ii. Source Water Quality Conditions</h5>
        <p>
          The complimentary maintenance framework is strictly subject to the input source water Total Dissolved Solids
          (TDS) levels not exceeding 1,500 ppm. Any accelerated component degradation, structural blockage, corrosion,
          or other damage caused by connecting the Product to unvetted, highly contaminated, industrial, or other
          non-standard domestic water sources shall constitute physical misuse by the Subscriber. The cost of repair,
          replacement of affected components, and all associated service charges shall be borne by the Subscriber.
          Where such misuse results in the Product becoming irreparably damaged, destroyed, or economically beyond
          repair, the provisions of Clause 1(i) relating to the defined Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the Product and
          the applicable liquidated damages schedule shall apply, and the Company shall be entitled to recover
          compensation in accordance with the depreciation schedule specified therein, subject to applicable law.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iii. Electricity &amp; Network Dependency</h5>
        <p>
          The Product requires a continuous electricity supply and internet/network connectivity to function properly
          and record water usage. The Subscriber is responsible for providing a stable power supply and network
          connection at the installation premises. The Company shall not be responsible for any interruption in
          service, temporary malfunction, or inaccurate usage records caused by power cuts, voltage fluctuations,
          internet outages, or other failures in the local electricity or communication network that are beyond the
          Company&apos;s control.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iv. Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h5>
        <p>
          In the event of a mechanical failure or breakdown, the Subscriber must raise a service ticket via the
          official AKVINZ portal, WhatsApp, or registered email. The Company will dispatch an authorized technician to
          diagnose and remedy the issue as per ticket registration.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">v. Proprietary Spares</h5>
        <p>
          Only Company certified parts may be used. The cost of all regular component replacements will be
          dynamically captured in the backend infrastructure logs for asset health tracing.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">vi. Malfunction &amp; Company Decision Authority</h5>
        <p>
          Following inspection by an authorized AKVINZ technician, the Company shall have sole discretion to determine
          the corrective action, which may include refixing the machine with spare parts or filters, replacing the
          machine with new or equivalent certified refurbished unit, or terminating the subscription agreement. The
          Subscriber agrees to accept and cooperate with the Company&apos;s decision without objection. Failure to
          cooperate shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, leading to immediate termination and
          forfeiture of the Security Deposit.

      <section className="space-y-3">
        <h4 className="text-white font-semibold">6. Relocation &amp; Address Updates</h4>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">i. Authorized Relocation Only</h5>
        <p>The Subscriber shall not de-install or move the Product to a new address independently.</p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">ii. Relocation Framework</h5>
        <p>
          The primary/first installation is completely free of charge. Subsequent address changes or internal unit
          shifting must be scheduled through the Company. A relocation service charge of ₹600 will apply per instance,
          subject to the Company checking service feasibility in the new locality.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iii. Relocation &amp; Unauthorized Removal Clause</h5>
        <p>
          The Subscriber must provide prior written notice to the Company before any shifting, removal, or
          reinstallation of the Product within the same/new premises. Such notice shall be valid only if raised
          through a registered email, official WhatsApp, or a ticket via the AKVINZ portal. Only Company-authorized
          personnel are permitted to carry out removal, relocation, or reinstallation. Any attempt by the Subscriber
          or third parties to independently uninstall or move the Product shall constitute a material breach,
          rendering this Agreement null and void with immediate effect. In such cases, the Subscriber shall be legally
          liable to pay the full defined MRP of the Product as liquidated damages, in addition to forfeiture of the
          Security Deposit. The Company reserves the right to initiate civil and/or criminal proceedings for
          unauthorized handling of its proprietary equipment.

        <h4 className="text-white font-semibold">7. Early Termination, Cancellation, &amp; Security Deposit Refunds</h4>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">i. Customer Cooperation</h5>
        <p>
          The Subscriber must provide timely access to the premises for service, inspection, or retrieval. Refusal or
          obstruction shall be treated as breach, leading to subscription termination and forfeiture of deposit.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">ii. Notice Period</h5>
        <p>The Subscriber may cancel the subscription at any point by serving a mandatory 30 days&apos; prior notice via the AKVINZ application or registered email.</p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iii. Asset Reclamation</h5>
        <p>
          Upon termination, the Subscriber must grant Company personnel safe entry to dismantle and retrieve the
          Product. If the Subscriber fails to provide access or behaves uncooperatively during retrieval, it will lead
          to the immediate forfeiture of the entire Security Deposit, without prejudice to the Company&apos;s right to
          pursue legal retrieval.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iv. Early Exit Adjustments</h5>
        <p>
          If a user opts out of Plan A or Plan B prior to completing the committed period, the rental difference
          between the actual tenure used and the committed slab will be deducted from the security deposit before
          final settlement. For clarity, this difference shall be calculated as:
        </p>
        <p className="italic text-gray-400">
          (Company&apos;s standard non-discounted monthly rental rate − Subscriber&apos;s discounted Plan monthly rental rate)
          × Number of months the Product was actually installed at the premises.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">v. Sufficiency of Recovery</h5>
        <p>
          If the calculated rental difference deficit or outstanding dues arising from an early exit exceed the
          available Security Deposit pool, the Company is explicitly authorized to automatically recover the
          remaining financial shortfall via the Subscriber&apos;s linked auto-debit profile setup under Clause 3.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">vi. Refund Processing</h5>
        <p>
          The remaining Security Deposit will be processed online and returned to the Subscriber&apos;s source bank
          account within 10 to 15 working days following a successful, damage-free asset retrieval report signed off
          by our technician.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">vii. Auto-Renewal</h5>
        <p>
          Unless the Subscriber serves the 30-day exit notice referred to above prior to expiry of the committed Plan
          A/Plan B tenure, this Agreement shall automatically renew on a month-to-month basis on the same terms, at
          the Company&apos;s then-prevailing standard monthly rental rate, until terminated by either party in accordance
          with this Clause 7.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">vii. Automatic Termination upon Insolvency or Bankruptcy</h5>

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200">1. Immediate Termination</p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall stand automatically
          terminated with immediate effect, without requiring any prior notice or a 30-day notice period, upon the
          occurrence of any of the following events:
        </p>
        <p>a. The Subscriber files a petition for insolvency or bankruptcy under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) or any other applicable laws.</p>
        <p>b. The Subscriber is adjudicated as insolvent or bankrupt by a competent court or tribunal.</p>
        <p>c. A liquidator, receiver, or administrator is appointed over the assets or estate of the Subscriber.</p>

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200">2. Exclusion of Asset from Insolvency Pool</p>
        <p>
          Since absolute ownership of the Product remains exclusively with the Company at all times (as per Clause 2),
          the Product does not constitute an asset of the Subscriber. It shall not be subject to any liquidation
          proceedings, debt-restructuring pools, or claims by the Subscriber&apos;s creditors.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200">3. Immediate Repossession Right</p>
        <p>
          Upon the occurrence of an insolvency event, the Company or its authorized representatives shall have an
          unconditional, immediate right to enter the installation premises to de-install and reclaim the Product. Any
          resistance, delay, or obstruction by the Subscriber, their family, or appointed insolvency professionals
          shall be treated as an illegal withholding of Company property, the Company reserves the right to initiate
          civil and/or criminal proceedings for unauthorized handling of its proprietary equipment.
        </p>

        <p className="font-medium text-gray-200">4. Financial Settlement</p>
        <p>
          In the event of insolvency, the entire Security Deposit shall be immediately forfeited to cover any unbilled
          water usage, outstanding rental dues, or deinstallation logistics, without prejudice to the Company&apos;s right
          to claim additional outstanding dues as an operational creditor.

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">ii. Late Payment Fee</h5>
        <p>
          If an auto-debit attempt fails, a one-time NACH/auto-debit-bounce charge of ₹100 will be levied for that
          attempt, and the overdue amount shall additionally accrue interest at 18% per annum (calculated on a daily
          pro-rata basis) until the outstanding amount, including such interest, is fully cleared. If the account
          remains past due for more than 30 consecutive days, the subscription will be suspended, access to water may
          be disabled electronically, the security deposit will be forfeited, and recovery actions will begin.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iii. Tampering &amp; Unauthorized Access</h5>
        <p>
          Any physical tampering with the internal components, breaking of factory seals, or altering the digital IoT
          flow meter will result in the immediate forfeiture of the full security deposit plus an explicit recovery
          charge covering the actual repair or total replacement value of the unit.
        </p>

        <h5 className="text-gray-200 font-medium">iv. Missed Service Appointments</h5>
        <p>
          If a subscriber schedules a repair or statutory inspection visit but denies entry or is unavailable without
          24 hours&apos; notice, a ₹500 missed-visit penalty will be appended to the next billing statement.

          verified by judicial review, the Company shall provide the Subscriber with a replacement machine free of
          cost, which shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Subscriber. In no event shall
          the Company be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential loss or damage (including loss
